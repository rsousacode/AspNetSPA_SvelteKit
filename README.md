# AspNetSPA_SvelteKit
## Overview

This repository serves as a template for building Single Page Applications (SPAs) using SvelteKit (version 5) in conjunction with ASP.NET Core services. It allows developers to seamlessly integrate the powerful features of ASP.NET Core with the dynamic front-end capabilities of SvelteKit.

## Resources
If you are following along with the tutorial, note that this template has been updated to utilize .NET 9.0 and SvelteKit (using Svelte 5) with TypeScript. For the original tutorial's code, refer to the `net7` branch.
